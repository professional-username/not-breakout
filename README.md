# Not Breakout

A simple web app to practice React, inspired by [Koen Van Gilst](https://pong-wars.vercel.app/). Consists of balls bouncing around and "breaking" blocks in the fashion of [breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)), except instead of destorying the block each ball will set it to its own color, effectively "creating" it for all balls of a different color.

Includes a number of settings and statistics for playing around with.
